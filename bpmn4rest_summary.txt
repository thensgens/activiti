BPMN4REST principles summary:


1) 	Modeling External Resources
	=> Intra process instances communication possible
	=> Model resource (container) that can be accessed via REST requests
	here: 	Not the endpoint (container) is implemented, but rather the client itself.
			A new 'REST Consumer task' has been added for that purpose.


2) 	Publishing Process Elements as Resources
	=> only inter-process instace communication is allowed
	=> Process elements are: Processes (definitions as well as instances), tasks and subprocesses

	a) 	Processes:
		URI: /{process}				 	(process definitions)
			x) 	POST requests should start an instance for the specified process definition. The result should 
				indicate the location URI for this instance (POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern)
				
		URI: /{process}/{instance} 		(process instances)
			x) 	GET requests should return the current status of the process instance.
				Depending on the media types, the request should return links to individual tasks that have been
				published as a resource.
				Maybe further filtering is required/needed (e.g. only list active tasks, ...)
			x) 	DELETE requests should shut the process instance down (and all related tasks)

	b) 	Tasks:							(all bpmn related and custom tasks, here: maybe only user tasks are applicable)
		URI: /{process}/{instance}/{task}
			x) 	GET requests should return task-specific information (e.g. its state, its input/output params)
			x) 	PUT requests should be able to change the state of a task and set the value of output params


3) 	Modeling Internal Resources: The Resource Request Event
