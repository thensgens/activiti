Necessary steps for the proof-of-concept:

1) Deploy and run a process which includes so called 'REST-Activities'.
   These activities should be exposed via REST.
     - GET requests on these activies should return e.g. 'the status'.
     - PUT requests on these activies should return e.g. 'end the execution'. or(!)
       control the process flow (see 3) )


2) New REST Webservice Task (alternative for current (SOAP-)Webservice task).

3) Emulate published (PUT-)Rest via UserTasks (in order to complete and control the flow)
