1) Deploy and run a process which includes so called 'REST-Activities'.
   These activities should be exposed via REST.
     - GET requests on these activies should return e.g. 'the status'.
     - PUT requests on these activies should return e.g. 'end the execution'. or(!)
       control the process flow (see 3) )


2) New REST Webservice Task (alternative for current (SOAP-)Webservice task).
	- simple proof-of-concept REST task implemented
	- still needs finalization (input fields/options/icons/...)

3) Emulate published (PUT-)Rest via UserTasks (in order to complete and control the flow)

4) REST-Event-Gateway

5) Moar?

Notes:

3) Still unknown how these user tasks could be emulated/implemented. Possibilities:
	- extend/change the deployer (deployer will behave differently if it encounters certain indicators,
	  e.g. manually replacing service tasks with user tasks in the corresponding xml file)
