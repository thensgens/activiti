Toolchain:

1) use $activiti-root/distro in order to build 'activiti-explorer' and 'activiti-rest' (and all other modules)
  1) cd to dir
  2) 'ant clean distro'

  This will ultimately build 'activiti-webapp-{explorer,rest]}2 projects and copy/move the resulting files
  to $activiti-root/distro/target/zip/activiti-{version}/wars (+ renaming).
  Afterwards the required WARs will be deployed on the (static) tomcat installation (see ant's build.xml for details).
  This projects depends on the modules specified in $activiti-root/modules (e.g. activiti-rest) via maven.
